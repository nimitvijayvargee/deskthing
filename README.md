# deskthing
Spotify car thing made for your desk!

This project uses a Raspberry Pi Pico W and some cheap components, which puts the components cost just around $10. It acts as an interface for your spotify playback, allowing you to change tracks, fast forward, pause or play from a single input knob. The design is based on the spotify car thing and a tiny FM radio look. The main assembly comprises of 4 screws, ssome basic assembly and 3 3D printed case parts. It is intended to be a quick, practical project that helps me keep my phone away; since I can do any music stuff on this device.
